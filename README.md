# Notion Weekify WebApp

This is a web app project to manage easily some functions in my notion workspace for university.
The first functionality this app will provide is to make an schedule based on th data stored in a notion database

The project uses svelte, typescript and jest for testing

I will also use this repo as svelte and css testing and cool stuf

This project is built from a template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It's based on the official one from <https://github.com/sveltejs/template>.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) run the following commands:

```bash
npx degit dceddia/svelte-typescript-jest svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

The notion api is currently in beta and web browser api-requests are not supported yet. The chrome instance to run this web app must be open with this command (windows)

```bash
C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=c:\my-chrome-data\data
```
